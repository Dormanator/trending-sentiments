# üìà Trending Sentiments

‚ö†Ô∏è **Disclaimer: In an unexpected plot twist, Twitter (renamed "X") decided their API is too cool for school and slapped a price tag on it. Sadly, this means our humble website, trendinsentiments.com, and its modest GitHub companion are now just quaint relics of a freer internet era. Peek at the code if you like, but running it? That's gonna cost you now. RIP free access.** ‚ö†Ô∏è
